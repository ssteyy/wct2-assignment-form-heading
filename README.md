# PHP Assignment: Form Handling

## Objective:
Create a simple PHP form handling logic from index.html that allows users to submit their details (name, email, and password). The form should validate the input and display a confirmation message once the form is successfully submitted. If the form contains errors, an error message should be displayed next to the respective fields.

### Instructions:
1. Validate the form input:
   - Name: Cannot be empty.
   - Email: Must be a valid email address.
   - Password: Must match.
2. Display errors:
   - If any of the fields are invalid, display an error message next to the respective field.
3. Show confirmation message:
   - If the form is successfully submitted and validated, show a confirmation message with the submitted details.
